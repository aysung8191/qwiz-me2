# Qwiz.me

**Created by:** Augustine Sung

**Technologies Used:** JavaScript, React, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, Node, CSS, Open Trivia DB API & ChuckNorris.io API

## Site Overview:
Qwiz.me is a site where students and learners of all kinds can come to improve their studying and memorization skills! Users can create flashcards and sets to run through and *quiz* themselves. Similar to Quizlet, users are free to choose any language, subject, etc., to create their own digital flashcard sets and master concepts faster.

Additionally, users can generate random trivia questions or jokes whenever they need a much-deserved break from studying - all pulled from public APIs (Open Trivia DB API & ChuckNorris.io API)

## Users can create their own flashcards and sets to run through!
